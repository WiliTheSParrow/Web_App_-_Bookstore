- He has explicitly requested that the libraries of Bootstrap and FancyBox must be used (below I leave the links). 

- When doing HOVER on each of the covers, it must be rotated to show the title, the description and a "More Info" button (This effect is just CSS. Google is your friend). This button will take you to a more detailed image ("detalle" in the json) of the cover (not the same image) that should be shown in a popup/modal and NOT in another website (FancyBox).



- (Optional) Books should be displayed with a little responsive behaviour. No need to fight with media queries, only a little adaptation with Bootstrap or plain flexbox would be enough.
